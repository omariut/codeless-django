### üî∏ Model and Field Builder
After creating the app:
* You‚Äôll see your app in the right panel (e.g., `user`).
* Under "Add Model", type your model name and click **`Add Model`**.
* Click the model name (e.g., `User`) to expand it.
* Now:

  * Click **`Add Field`** to define model fields like `CharField`, `IntegerField`, etc.
  * Set the field name and options (e.g., `max_length`, `default`, `null`).
* Optionally, click **`Add Meta`** to add class-level options like `ordering` or `verbose_name`.

Repeat this process for as many models and fields as you need.

## ‚úÖ Final Step: Create Apps

After adding all your models and fields:

* Hit the **`Create Apps`** button to generate files.
* Select:

  * ‚úÖ `API View` ‚Äì if you want REST API views generated.

* Your Django app will now include:

  * `models.py`
  * `serializers.py` (if API View checked)
  * `views.py`
  * `urls.py`
  * `admin.py`
